# beginner-credit-scoring-project-ML
Learning project in which I explore Credit Scoring using Python, data analysis, and basic Machine Learning techniques.

While the "NoslegumaDarbs_Alksnitis.ipynb" file focuses more on ML, the "Statistical tests" folder contains an additional Jupyter workbook where I explore statistical tests in Python on a different dataset.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES
- Explore and understand a credit dataset.
- Manually calculate the credit score.
- Visualize distributions, correlations.
- Build a Machine Learning model to predict customer credit score.
